Hello and welcome to React Girls workshop ⚛️!

This tutorial will take you step by step on how to create your own todo list application using React and TypeScript.

> At the moment, it's not possible to complete this without a mentor as it lacks thorough explanation of every step. Actually, that's what your mentors are here for, right? 🤗
